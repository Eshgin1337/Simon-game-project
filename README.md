## Simon Game 

  There are four buttons for game patterns, and one hover-animated button for getting help from the game. Initially the game will animate a random button, if you click 
right it will choose another button to animate randomly, you will need to remember previus patterns as well. If you forget it, you will have three chances to get help.
It will start animating from first to last when help button is clicked.

  If you press not a correct button, the gameover will be animated and you will have to press any button to start again. When you want to start game, you should also 
click any button to start.
